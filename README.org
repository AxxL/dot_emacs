# -*- mode: org -*-

*dot-emacs* is my personal .emacs for Emacs 24 on Windows.

* Files

  - init.el: The main file located at =~/.emacs.d/init.el=
  - custom.el: customizations by =M-x customize=
  - init_emacs_basic.el: Basic customizations for every mode
  - init_emacs_js.el: Customizations especially for JavaScript editing


* Usage

The =init.el= file contains some additional lines for stuff that I'm still
testing. In the end this file should contain at least this lines:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; Load external files
(setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
(load custom-file)

(load "~/.emacs.d/init_emacs_basic.el")

(load "~/.emacs.d/init_emacs_js.el")
#+END_EXAMPLE

That loads the three additional files: =custom.el= which is used by the
customization functionality of Emacs (=(load custom file)=),
=init_emacs_basic.el= and =init_emacs_js.el=.



* Modes used

I use a lot of modes that have been accumulated over the years. I threw away
some modes, and I'm still testing and I bet I will use some other modes in
the future. Anyway, I think this list is nearly complete.
